The MediaWiki action API is a web service that provides convenient access to wiki features, data, and meta-data over HTTP, via a URL usually at api.php. Clients request particular "actions" by specifying an action parameter, mainly action=query to get information. It was known as the MediaWiki API, but MediaWiki now offers other web APIs such RESTBase and the Wikidata query service.
